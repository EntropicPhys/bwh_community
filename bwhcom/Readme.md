# Bifurcation Analysis of a Trait-Based Community Model

This repository contains MATLAB code for generating bifurcation diagrams in a trait-structured community dynamics model. 

For detailed usage instructions and model formulation, please refer to the accompanying PDF manual.

## Quick Start

1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the repository folder.
2. Run the main script:

   ```matlab
   run('cmds1.m') % numerical bifurcation 
   run('cmds2.m') % Direct numerical simulations & Brute-force BB.
