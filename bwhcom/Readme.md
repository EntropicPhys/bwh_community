# Bifurcation Analysis of a Trait-Based Community Model

This repository contains MATLAB code for generating bifurcation diagrams in a trait-structured community dynamics model. The implementation supports the analysis of equilibrium structure and pattern transitions under varying ecological parameters.

For detailed usage instructions and model formulation, please refer to the accompanying PDF manual.

## Quick Start

1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the repository folder.
2. Run the main script:

   ```matlab
   run('main.m')
